# Bachelor

This is the code from my bachelor project

In addition to  a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web application (student_alloc) it includes an nginx reverse proxy and a jenkins instance, all containerised individually.

The web application is an interface to an underlying solver module, that solves the problem of assigning (groups of) students to a list of available topics.

After the conclusion of my bachelor project I was hired by my supervisor to continue the development of the application, as well as modifying it to be used as the front for an exam scheduling solver.
